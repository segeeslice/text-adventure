# Text Adventure

The goal for this project as of now is to be a text-based adventure game **framework** in which anyone can download and play their own adventures. Users could simply run someone else's adventure or create their own.

A text adventure will likely be formatted via a series of [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) files. For example, travelling to a new area will simply mean loading an JSON object from a new file. The files will likely reference each other by name.

With a format like this, the primary key is wide-scale organization, which I hope to get some practice with through this project. Even if this project reaches no one, I want it to be framed as if it could be used by anyone. Perhaps I could even add a utility later to assist with the making of JSON files, although it is currently out of scope.

Stay tuned. :)
